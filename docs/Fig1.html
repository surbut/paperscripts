Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development

The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/surbut/paperscripts/tree/7eb10adba212fdfc9e2cf9862c34ca466bde79ec" target="_blank">7eb10ad</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
